Description: DoubletFinder identifies doublets by generating
    artificial doublets from existing scRNA-seq data and defining which
    real cells preferentially co-localize with artificial doublets in gene
    expression space. Other DoubletFinder package functions are used for
    fitting DoubletFinder to different scRNA-seq datasets. For example,
    ideal DoubletFinder performance in real-world contexts requires (I)
    Optimal pK selection and (2) Homotypic doublet proportion estimation.
    pK selection is achieved using pN-pK parameter sweeps and maxima
    identification in mean-variance-normalized bimodality coefficient
    distributions. Homotypic doublet proportion estimation is achieved by
    finding the sum of squared cell annotation frequencies. For more
    information, see our Cell Sysmtes paper
